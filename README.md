# react_routing_basic

This project is created based on the example from https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial 

In this exercise, you will learn how to create declarative routing project in ReactJS.

This is sample project about IPL players and teams.

A small list of players is already added.

Exercise 1: Create a blank project and then replciate the functiponality of this project.

Exercise 2: Add new players to the list in the database. In addition, change the fields and data for players.

Exercise 3: Add new teams, similar to players, in the systems. To this end, you will have to create a new database for teams.

Exercise 4: Create a new route for match venues. The venues will also have a list (similar to players and teams). Add details (such as location, capacity etc) about the venues.
